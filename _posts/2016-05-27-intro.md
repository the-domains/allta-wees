When I was eleven, I studied **_[Chris Osgood][0]._**

I stayed up late in bed three nights in a row reviewing his posture and sketching every last detail into his polyester knit jersey. I remember beaming as I looked upon the completed "masterpiece" of the Canadian net-minder, then quickly casting it aside. 

My intent had been to submit the work to _Sports Illustrated: for Kid's_ Art Gallery page -- a section of modest art work done by its readers -- it would, however, never be seen by anyone besides me. That is often the case with creating something, you fall in love with your own idea, you build up the courage to tackle the very thing you conceptualize and even the times you don't abandon the pursuit of the idea you had, a myriad of personal barriers remain in sharing that very thing you've fostered to others. 

Perfection is a pointless pursuit, often an excuse used by those skeptical in their own convictions. What we share is often unfinished and disliked my half of those who see it, not unlike the creators themselves. Finding your _voice_ is an ongoing process, least not let others hinder its pursuit.

That what this is, an adult (still) attempting to summon the courage for himself and that eleven year old to share his ideas with others. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b78c86aa-ddeb-4b5b-8423-45e54ee878b9.jpg)
